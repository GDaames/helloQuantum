# helloQuantum
intro to Qiskit, getting started.

This was my first attempt at executing code on IBMQ machines in 2019.
I am layman when it comes to QC, however i am experienced in programming and this is what ultimately led me to 
installing and eventually executing some code using Qiskit, and have decided to create this repository.
(Internet coverage is pretty weak in my country so its been diffucult to access anything.)

The tutorial follows the youtube playlist made by the Qiskit team on their (Qiskit) channel.
it startes with basic setup and continues through to connecting to the IBMQ Experience and:
- creating first entangled qubits
- creating first quantum gate
- discovering quantum teleportation

The goal of this tutorial is to replicate the Bernstein-Vasirani algorithm 
and write a basic hello world program using the topics covered.

I will be updating this repository more regularly.
